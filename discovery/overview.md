Have you ever wonder where that particular build task was used? This extension adds an additional tab in Build and Release hub that lets you:

- See installed tasks
- Search for a specific task
- View details of a selected task:
    - Installed versions
    - Build definitions that use it
    - Status of the latest builds that use it

Since a task can be used in any team project an option is available on the details page to show which definitions the selected task is used regardless of project.
